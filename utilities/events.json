It is a celebration of the art of the instrument, not just the sound you can record from it. Future revival, swamptronica, spaghetti-step, electro-twang ‚Äî whatever you call Dirtwire‚Äôs music, what matters is that you can dance to it, as sure as a lizard dances in the desert.\n\nDirtwire, comprised of lifelong friends and musicians Evan Fraser, David Satori, and Mark Reveley, are touring now in support of their new record ‚ÄúRoad Goes All Night‚Äù. The road goes further yet, friends. Come see where it leads at a show near you.",

Melody unites it all - whimsical keys and curious synth patterns that stir a wide range of emotions and get lodged deep in the memory. For Atish, the challenge is to lead an audience into unexpected new worlds: they won't know how they got there but will be delighted when they arrive. It's a subtle skill he has mastered\nwhile never taking himself too seriously.",
