    "description": "I create spaces and have designed everything from environmental nightclubs to a global network of [freespaces]. For the last 6 years I turned my focus to the global human migration crisis where I've been setting up alternatives to traditional refugee camps where the refugees themselves take a leading role in their design and implementation, flipping the traditional humanitarian model. As project manager for Elpida Home in 2016, I lead a team of volunteers, refugees and local Greek contractors to build a prototype camp that what was widely recognized as the most dignified living conditions for refugees in all of Greece. Since leaving Greece I've continued investigating refugee situations from integration in Europe to the protracted and new situations that exist in Uganda and Bangladesh. The cutting edge thoughts on the future of education, work, governance, place making, blockchain and protests can be applied to advancing the cause of displaced peoples around the globe. Like many others, I believe that the current system of international aid is broken and we need to actively create many alternative prototypes... and fast. Refugee camps are the cities of the future where leapfrog urbanism is possible. In order for this vision to become a reality it will take all of us, refugees themselves and the general population, especially those who don't see themselves as traditional humanitarians. Together we will figure this out.",

    "tags": "presentation, AI, innovation",
    "description": "De Kai is Professor of Computer Science and Engineering at HKUST, and Distinguished Research Scholar at Berkeley's International Computer Science Institute. He is among only 17 scientists worldwide named by the Association for Computational Linguistics as a Founding ACL Fellow, for his pioneering contributions to machine translation and machine learning foundations of systems like the Google/Yahoo/Microsoft translators. Recruited as founding faculty of HKUST directly from UC Berkeley, where his PhD thesis was one of the first to spur the paradigm shift toward machine learning based natural language processing technologies, he founded HKUST's internationally funded Human Language Technology Center which launched the world's first web translator over twenty years ago.\n\nDe Kai's cross-disciplinary work relating music, language, intelligence, and culture centers on enabling cultures to relate, and stems from a liberal arts perspective emphasizing creativity in both technical and humanistic dimensions. A native of St Louis, he worked and traveled extensively in San Francisco, New York, Germany, Spain, China, India and Canada before joining Hong Kong's ambitious creation of Asia's now top-ranked HKUST, where his pioneering contributions to machine learning of the cognitive relationships between different languages led to the foundations of modern machine translation technology, with broad applications in computer music and computational musicology as well as human language processing.\n\nDuring his doctoral studies in cognitive science, artificial intelligence and computational linguistics at Berkeley, he worked on seminal projects on intelligent conversational dialog agents. His PhD dissertation employing maximum entropy to model human perception and interpretation of ambiguities was one of the first to spur the paradigm shift toward today's state-of-the-art statistical natural language processing technologies. De Kai also holds an executive MBA from Kellogg (Northwestern University) and HKUST. His undergraduate degree at UCSD was awarded cum laude, Phi Beta Kappa, and won the liberal arts oriented Revelle College's department award.\n\nIn 2015, Debrett's HK 100 named De Kai as one of the 100 most influential figures of Hong Kong.\n\nIn 2019, Google named De Kai as one of eight inaugural members of its AI Ethics council, ATEAC (Advanced Technology External Advisory Council).",

She was also a Soprano in the prestigious Oakland Symphony Chorus/Chamber Singers. After being commissioned to sing opera at various SF Bay Area parties and events, she decided that Opera is a passion that pushes her musicianship and performance skill levels. She originally created a one woman show as a Lyric Soprano accompanied by complete orchestral background tracks to famous operatic arias from the classics. You may catch her popping up and performing on the streets of San Francisco, or at a prestigious event like the Edwardian Ball SF (3 years in a row performing in the main Ballroom) or even at well known festivals like Lightning in a Bottle (2 years in a row on Grand Artique Stage), Oregon Country Fair, Piedmont Foodfest, and much much more. She also integrates her experience as a performer in theater and circus arts. A pleasure to your ear and soul....she hopes you catch a Renegade Opera performance near you!",

Together they explore the concept of storytelling through the cyclic progression of psychedelic techno. Their mission is to bring the auditor into a different world staged by sensations of physical quantum traveling.

    "description": "Dirtwire is a traveler’s collage of Earth-borne instruments and electronic sounds foraged from Electric Forest to the mountains of Tuva. From their home on the west coast of the United States to far-flung destinations all over the world, these troubadours are welcomed for speaking the most unifying language there is: music.\n\nEvery live set is a magician’s surprise show, an invitation to experience instruments that are usually heard only as samples in electronic music. It is a celebration of the art of the instrument, not just the sound you can record from it. Future revival, swamptronica, spaghetti-step, electro-twang — whatever you call Dirtwire’s music, what matters is that you can dance to it, as sure as a lizard dances in the desert.\n\nDirtwire, comprised of lifelong friends and musicians Evan Fraser, David Satori, and Mark Reveley, are touring now in support of their new record “Road Goes All Night”. The road goes further yet, friends. Come see where it leads at a show near you.",

As an unmistakably warm person, he has quickly built up a dedicated fan base that feeds off his passion and energy. The Atish experience is about more than just dancing - it's about connection.\n\nThere is an intimacy and elegance to the music Atish plays whether it's deep house, Romanian minimal, artful techno, or emotive progressive house. Melody unites it all - whimsical keys and curious synth patterns that stir a wide range of emotions and get lodged deep in the memory. For Atish, the challenge is to lead an audience into unexpected new worlds: they won't know how they got there but will be delighted when they arrive. It's a subtle skill he has mastered\nwhile never taking himself too seriously.",

In 2004 he wondered onto the Indian sub-continent, and stumbled into Goa, completely unaware that he was about to have his life changed. In Goa he had his first encounter with this thing known as Trance Music. After dancing at a couple of parties he decided to become a DJ. He is heavily influenced by sound by all psychedelic music in the world. In 2006, with the aid of DAW, he wanted to create an original sound. He then went on to begin producing his own music. Gu is full of dark sounds with groovy bass lines being his signature.",

    "description": "As a form of personal therapy, Egon’s Embrace is an alter ego, an ongoing metamorphosis that allows me to explore parts of my personality that are often impossible to explore in everyday life. I often see myself as an anomaly in psychedelic trance world as my guiding thread in creating music is self-indulgence. I take my feelings and introspections about a world and people as a starting point and turn them into an expressive art form that is almost like a painting drawn with sounds. As such, Egon’s Embrace is very personal and expressive testimony to challenging, often harrowing, periods of my life. As a combination of despair, melancholy, anguish, joy, and ultimately hope, it is as much philosophy or poetry as it is music. I see it as an open invitation for the audience to have a voyeuristic peak into my soul and endure whatever screams back at them. After all, all I want is to create something that takes them someplace otherworldly.\n\nIn the end, although Egon’s Embrace is drawn towards the darker psychedelic sound, there is still a bit of a dreamer in it otherwise. Close your eyes, take a deep breath, and drown with me.",

He also owns & runs the “Digital Structures” label, where he publishes more tech-orientated sounds under the Yuli Fershtat moniker.\n",

His sets can travel a diverse range yet maintain a conscious groove of cohesiveness, always appropriate to the time and place. They are thoughtful, yet never pre-planned, with artfully-timed track selections that spark any dance floor, appealing to the old school just as much as the new. Galen has toured extensively in his career throughout the United States as well major clubs and festivals in Europe, Central America, and Asia.",

    "description": "200 Micrograms are Riktam & Bansi of GMS with Raja Ram and Chicago. The combination of these guys talents, enthusiasm and sheer joy bursts out into the tracks whenever they get chance to lock into the studio in Ibiza. Its not beats per minute (BPM) but thrills per minute (TPM) and they hit high. Action packed Psy Trance that fills the biggest of festivals with hysteria...if you are not a follower be so now.",

    "description": "Tsuyoshi Suzuki is an internationally-acclaimed DJ and producer from Tokyo. At the leading edge of the psychedelic trance movement for a quarter of a century, Tsuyoshi continues to thrill crowds all over the world with his uniquely focused style of mixing and psychedelic music selection.\nA former art department film student at Nippon University in the 1980s, Tsuyoshi’s life turned to music when he was exposed to the evocative and futuristic DJ’ing of KUDO at the club Yellow in Nishi-Azabu, Tokyo in the early 1990s. Visiting India and immersing himself in the emerging Goa sound, Tsuyoshi formed the band Taiyo (which would later become Prana) with Nick Taylor, who had also been influenced by KUDO’s music.",
