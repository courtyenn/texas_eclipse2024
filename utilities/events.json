    "tags": "presentation, humanitarianism",
    "description": "I create spaces and have designed everything from environmental nightclubs to a global network of [freespaces]. For the last 6 years I turned my focus to the global human migration crisis where I've been setting up alternatives to traditional refugee camps where the refugees themselves take a leading role in their design and implementation, flipping the traditional humanitarian model. As project manager for Elpida Home in 2016, I lead a team of volunteers, refugees and local Greek contractors to build a prototype camp that what was widely recognized as the most dignified living conditions for refugees in all of Greece. Since leaving Greece I've continued investigating refugee situations from integration in Europe to the protracted and new situations that exist in Uganda and Bangladesh. The cutting edge thoughts on the future of education, work, governance, place making, blockchain and protests can be applied to advancing the cause of displaced peoples around the globe. Like many others, I believe that the current system of international aid is broken and we need to actively create many alternative prototypes... and fast. Refugee camps are the cities of the future where leapfrog urbanism is possible. In order for this vision to become a reality it will take all of us, refugees themselves and the general population, especially those who don't see themselves as traditional humanitarians. Together we will figure this out.",

    "tags": "presentation, AI, innovation",
    "description": "De Kai is Professor of Computer Science and Engineering at HKUST, and Distinguished Research Scholar at Berkeley's International Computer Science Institute. He is among only 17 scientists worldwide named by the Association for Computational Linguistics as a Founding ACL Fellow, for his pioneering contributions to machine translation and machine learning foundations of systems like the Google/Yahoo/Microsoft translators. Recruited as founding faculty of HKUST directly from UC Berkeley, where his PhD thesis was one of the first to spur the paradigm shift toward machine learning based natural language processing technologies, he founded HKUST's internationally funded Human Language Technology Center which launched the world's first web translator over twenty years ago.\n\nDe Kai's cross-disciplinary work relating music, language, intelligence, and culture centers on enabling cultures to relate, and stems from a liberal arts perspective emphasizing creativity in both technical and humanistic dimensions. A native of St Louis, he worked and traveled extensively in San Francisco, New York, Germany, Spain, China, India and Canada before joining Hong Kong's ambitious creation of Asia's now top-ranked HKUST, where his pioneering contributions to machine learning of the cognitive relationships between different languages led to the foundations of modern machine translation technology, with broad applications in computer music and computational musicology as well as human language processing.\n\nDuring his doctoral studies in cognitive science, artificial intelligence and computational linguistics at Berkeley, he worked on seminal projects on intelligent conversational dialog agents. His PhD dissertation employing maximum entropy to model human perception and interpretation of ambiguities was one of the first to spur the paradigm shift toward today's state-of-the-art statistical natural language processing technologies. De Kai also holds an executive MBA from Kellogg (Northwestern University) and HKUST. His undergraduate degree at UCSD was awarded cum laude, Phi Beta Kappa, and won the liberal arts oriented Revelle College's department award.\n\nIn 2015, Debrett's HK 100 named De Kai as one of the 100 most influential figures of Hong Kong.\n\nIn 2019, Google named De Kai as one of eight inaugural members of its AI Ethics council, ATEAC (Advanced Technology External Advisory Council).",

She was also a Soprano in the prestigious Oakland Symphony Chorus/Chamber Singers. After being commissioned to sing opera at various SF Bay Area parties and events, she decided that Opera is a passion that pushes her musicianship and performance skill levels. She originally created a one woman show as a Lyric Soprano accompanied by complete orchestral background tracks to famous operatic arias from the classics. You may catch her popping up and performing on the streets of San Francisco, or at a prestigious event like the Edwardian Ball SF (3 years in a row performing in the main Ballroom) or even at well known festivals like Lightning in a Bottle (2 years in a row on Grand Artique Stage), Oregon Country Fair, Piedmont Foodfest, and much much more. She also integrates her experience as a performer in theater and circus arts. A pleasure to your ear and soul....she hopes you catch a Renegade Opera performance near you!",

Their followers delight in these rituals; all bear witnesses to their higher selves and joyously bask in the eternal light that joins us all as one.

By 2012, KROMAGON was recognized by the internationally-renowned label Zenon Records, becoming the very first label artist in the USA. \n\nHe delivers deep journeys with driving basslines using surgically technical precision and undeniably crisp production. The listener cannot resist but to be spellbound by the grimly psychedelic sound effects and intoxicated by neo-apocalyptic atmospheres. You’ll undoubtedly hear the underlying influences of alternate styles like metal, industrial and electronic genres such as EBM and old school tech-trance.",

    "description": "For Dustin Goodwin aka BigRedMachine, all roads lead back to the dancefloor. Whether as a dancer or a DJ, the common denominator between all of his creative pursuits is a dedication to finding the next groove.\n\nBigRedMachine once toured the US as a professional dancer, performing at competitions and on stages of festivals organized by Insomniac. He’s spending his second chapter proving that this period wasn’t his peak. Not only did he help found blockchain conference ETHDenver in the years since, but he’s played records at leading web3 events such as NFT.NYC, Art Basel and Consensus.\n\nIf it wasn’t for dance music and the connections it’s brought him, BigRedMachine wouldn’t likely enjoy as many opportunities in the crypto space. It is in this way that life has brought him full circle, allowing him to channel the joy and abundance he’s achieved through his selections. BigRedMachine’s heart beats to these rhythms — the same as each dancer on the opposite side of the decks. Needless to say, he’s been in their shoes.\n\nBigRedMachine’s newfound fan base can look forward to original music releases that capture a cross-section of the house and techno spectrum. In the meantime, expect to see him on a dancefloor near you.",

    "description": "Everything we know and we do in the universe is the result of countless complex reactions happening as much in the quantic level of reality as in our own realm of reality. These cause and effect processes are the product of a dual conception of gravity that previously were though to be incompatible, but are now on their way to being unified into one all encompassing theory that we can call Quantaloop.\n\nQuantaloop is the collaboration of two minds, Pasquale De Luca and Étienne Sarrazin. Together they explore the concept of storytelling through the cyclic progression of psychedelic techno. Their mission is to bring the auditor into a different world staged by sensations of physical quantum traveling. Elusive and twisted motives meet hypnotic ornamentation all surrounded by time morphing atmospheres. All of this to pull the listener into their quantic orbit.",

These cause and effect processes are the product of a dual conception of gravity that previously were though to be incompatible, but are now on their way to being unified into one all encompassing theory that we can call Quantaloop.\n\nQuantaloop is the collaboration of two minds, Pasquale De Luca and Étienne Sarrazin. Together they explore the concept of storytelling through the cyclic progression of psychedelic techno. Their mission is to bring the auditor into a different world staged by sensations of physical quantum traveling. Elusive and twisted motives meet hypnotic ornamentation all surrounded by time morphing atmospheres. All of this to pull the listener into their quantic orbit.",

Treavor established himself as one of the top Djs in LA thru these events and has since traveled the world from Brazil to Japan to Morocco, Portugal, Germany and all over North America. As a Dj it’s always been his diversity that’s set him apart, as his love for music spans multiple genres and his DJing reflects this. Over the years Treavor has also established himself as a dynamic music producer having released music under several project names. His most notable project is Desert Dwellers with his partner on the project Amani Friend. In recent years he has started a new solo project called PheuZen that focuses on more abstract forms of Electronica.",

As an unmistakably warm person, he has quickly built up a dedicated fan base that feeds off his passion and energy. The Atish experience is about more than just dancing - it's about connection.\n\nThere is an intimacy and elegance to the music Atish plays whether it's deep house, Romanian minimal, artful techno, or emotive progressive house. Melody unites it all - whimsical keys and curious synth patterns that stir a wide range of emotions and get lodged deep in the memory. For Atish, the challenge is to lead an audience into unexpected new worlds: they won't know how they got there but will be delighted when they arrive. It's a subtle skill he has mastered\nwhile never taking himself too seriously.",

Treavor established himself as one of the top Djs in LA thru these events and has since traveled the world from Brazil to Japan to Morocco, Portugal, Germany and all over North America. As a Dj it’s always been his diversity that’s set him apart, as his love for music spans multiple genres and his DJing reflects this. Over the years Treavor has also established himself as a dynamic music producer having released music under several project names. His most notable project is Desert Dwellers with his partner on the project Amani Friend. In recent years he has started a new solo project called PheuZen that focuses on more abstract forms of Electronica."

    "description": "As a form of personal therapy, Egon’s Embrace is an alter ego, an ongoing metamorphosis that allows me to explore parts of my personality that are often impossible to explore in everyday life. I often see myself as an anomaly in psychedelic trance world as my guiding thread in creating music is self-indulgence. I take my feelings and introspections about a world and people as a starting point and turn them into an expressive art form that is almost like a painting drawn with sounds. As such, Egon’s Embrace is very personal and expressive testimony to challenging, often harrowing, periods of my life. As a combination of despair, melancholy, anguish, joy, and ultimately hope, it is as much philosophy or poetry as it is music. I see it as an open invitation for the audience to have a voyeuristic peak into my soul and endure whatever screams back at them. After all, all I want is to create something that takes them someplace otherworldly.\n\nIn the end, although Egon’s Embrace is drawn towards the darker psychedelic sound, there is still a bit of a dreamer in it otherwise. Close your eyes, take a deep breath, and drown with me.",

Perfect Stranger ultimately created his own sub-genre in the psychedelic scene by presenting a totally distinctive sound characterized by groovy playful beats and patiently built compositions that often bridge between progressive trance and techno with a presence of tribal and psychedelic elements.\n\nPerfect Stranger has released 3 full artist albums, 3 remix albums, 3 compilations and appears on well over a hundred other releases (compilations, EPs, albums, etc.). He also owns & runs the “Digital Structures” label, where he publishes more tech-orientated sounds under the Yuli Fershtat moniker.\n",

His sets can travel a diverse range yet maintain a conscious groove of cohesiveness, always appropriate to the time and place. They are thoughtful, yet never pre-planned, with artfully-timed track selections that spark any dance floor, appealing to the old school just as much as the new.
